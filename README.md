# VerySimpleIK
A very simple IK system using FABRIK (forward and backward reaching inverse kinematics) with simple editor outlines visualization.

# Quick Start
Just add the FABRIK Root component to the root joint, and assign the leaf and the target (end effector). You can also add pole and set iterations.
In the demo scenes, pole object is in yellow, and target object is in red. The editor visualizes the max distance the IK chain can reach, and marks the shortest line to target object with a dashed line.
